Feature: viewAvailableSeats

 As a user,
 I want to view the available seats for a specific movie screening so that I see which seats I can potentially occupy during the movie.

Scenario: viewAvailableSeats
  Given I am on the seatSelection page for "Example Movie 2"
  And the screening time "Sunday : 1:00:00", 
  Then I am shown a seating map for this screening time
  And the taken seats for this screening time are displayed
