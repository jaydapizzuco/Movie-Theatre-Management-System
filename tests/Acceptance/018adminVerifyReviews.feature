Feature: adminVerifyReviews

 As an administrator, 
 I want to be able to read user reviews so that I can approve or reject them.

 Scenario: admin approves or rejects user reviews
	Given I am logged into an admin account and I am on the admin profile page,
	When I click on view user reviews,
	Then I am redirected to the Newly Submitted Reviews Page and see the reviews with status
